A Slice 4 My Life!
This repository contains the solution to the Concurrency Exam assignment INFCOCx1-A for the academic year 2024-2025. The goal is to implement a multithreaded simulation of a fast-pickup pizza restaurant using .NET 6.

The application features:

N pizzaioli (pizza makers) collaboratively creating pizzas one slice at a time.
N customers independently ordering and picking up a single slice of pizza.
A thread-safe implementation ensuring fairness and correctness.
Synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes, locks, or semaphores to manage shared resources like orders, the kitchen space, and pickup areas.
Key Functional Requirements
Fairness & Correctness: Every thread must complete its tasks without interference, ensuring order and pickup consistency.
Efficient Concurrency: Minimize locking while avoiding spinning and overprotection.
Separation of Responsibilities: Pizzaioli prepare the slices collaboratively; customers take turns picking up slices.
Thread Safety: No random interleaving or race conditions.
Project Constraints
No user interaction: Fully autonomous simulation with predefined input parameters.
Cross-platform support: The solution runs on any system supporting .NET 6.
Standard libraries only: Avoid external libraries, async/await, or parallel-for constructs.
No spinning: Ensure synchronization without unnecessary CPU load.
Evaluation Criteria
The repository follows strict guidelines for thread-safe design, logical correctness, and adherence to the project‚Äôs constraints. Testing includes a variety of configurations for thread counts, pizza slices, and workload.
